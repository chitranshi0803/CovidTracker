            <span style="font-style:normal;">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease
                spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are
                expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do
                not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these
                droplets from a person infected with the virus. This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter)
                away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables,
                doorknobs and handrails. People can become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching
                their eyes, nose or mouth. This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water
                or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.

                WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated
                findings.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others
                and yourself.
                When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially
                important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing. Since some infected persons may
                not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with
                everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with
                common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can
                survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24
                hours on cardboard.

                As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
                touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth
                and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home,
                wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products.

                There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">How to wash fruits and vegetables?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you should do
                under any circumstance: before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and
                vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused
                by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
                treatment of COVID-19. In hospitals physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat
                secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They
                should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">How long does it take after exposure to COVID-19 to develop symptoms?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six
                days but can range from 1 â€“ 14 days.

            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">What is the connection between COVID-19 and animals?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                COVID-19 is spread through human-to-human transmission.
                We already know a lot about other viruses in the coronavirus family and most of these types of viruses
                have an origin in animals. The COVID-19 virus (also called SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus in humans. The
                possible animal source of COVID-19 has not yet been confirmed but research is ongoing.

                WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update, as new
                findings are available.
            </span>

        <div class="pt-3">
            <h4 class="display-5 text-danger">Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet or other animals?</h4>
            <span style="font-style:normal;">
                Several dogs and cats (domestic cats and tigers) in contact with infected humans have tested positive
                for COVID-19. In addition, ferrets appear to be susceptible to the infection. In experimental
                conditions, both cats and ferrets were able to transmit infection to other animals of the same species.
                However, there is no evidence that these animals can transmit the disease to humans and spread COVID-19.
                COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.
